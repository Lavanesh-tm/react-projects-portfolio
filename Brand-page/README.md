# Brand Landing Page — React + Vite

This project is a polished, production‑style landing page inspired by Nike’s modern branding approach.  
The goal was to build a clean, responsive interface using React and Vite while focusing on layout quality, component structure, and custom CSS design.

## Preview

Below is an interface preview from the running development build:

## Overview

The page is structured around two core components:

- **Navigation Bar** — A glass‑style top navigation with subtle gradients and hover effects
- **Hero Section** — Product‑focused layout with gradient background, floating shoe image, and platform availability badges

All styling is handwritten using CSS, with specific attention to gradients, spacing, text glow, and overall brand consistency.

## Technologies

- **React (Vite)**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS3**
- **Vite Dev Server + Build Tools**

npm install
```

Start the local dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see something like:

```

## Focus Areas

This project was built to demonstrate:

- Clean component architecture
- Brand‑oriented hero section design
- Gradient and glow‑based typography
- Custom CSS without relying on UI libraries
- Asset handling through Vite’s public directory

---

## Future Work

- Add product blocks or highlights
- Add scroll animations
- Improve mobile navigation
- Deploy to Vercel or Netlify for a public demo

---

## Notes

This project is part of my UI/Front‑End practice to refine layout design, styling depth, and component structure in React.
